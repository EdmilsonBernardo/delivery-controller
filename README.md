# :monocle_face: About
This project was developed to simulate a delivery manager, without communication with the back-end. For its execution, I use the concept of SPA ( Single-page application ) to make the application more fluid. So I decided to use React Router to manage the routes. State management is done using the Context API, as this application is small.
